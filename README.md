Swift Selection Search
=================

#### Description

Swift Selection Search (SSS) is an add-on for quickly searching for some text in a page using your favorite search engines.

Select text on a page and a small popup box with search engines will appear above your cursor. Press one and you'll automatically search for the selected text using that engine!

SSS is configurable. You can define which search engines appear on the popup, the appearance of the icons, what happens when you click them, where the popup appears, whether or not to hide it when the page scrolls, if you want to auto copy text on selection, and many more options.

You also get an optional context menu for searching with any of your engines. You can disable this extra menu in the options if you want. You also have the option of disabling the popup itself and leaving only this context menu. Your choice. :)

SSS is available at the Mozilla Add-ons website, here:
https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/swift-selection-search/
